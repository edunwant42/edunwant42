## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Abderrahmane

I'm currently a student at **ISTA NTIC Rabat, Morocco**, where I'm focusing on building strong skills in **web development** and **software engineering**.

This GitHub account is dedicated to my **academic journey**, a space where I share class projects, coding exercises, experiments, and everything I learn along the way.

ðŸ’¡ My goal is to grow as a developer through continuous learning and hands-on practice.
